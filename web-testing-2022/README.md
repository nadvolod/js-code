## TA 1

## ⚙️ Setup

The safest way to ensure that we all have the same environment is for us to [use Gitpod](#gitpod-setup) for our workshop. However, if you are comfortable doing so, you are free to setup the environment on your machine as well.

### Sign up for accounts

1. Free [Happo.io account](https://happo.io/signup?_aid=802)
1. Free [Github account](https://github.com/signup)

---

## Gitpod setup

ℹ️ Gitpod lets you run an entire Dev environment from a browser! You can use this approach if you don't know how to setup a local environment.

### Fork the repo

1. Sign up for a free [Github account](https://github.com/)
2. Fork this respository

- Make sure you are logged into Github
- click the Fork in the upper right of the Github.
- Give the repo a ⭐ or you can't participate in the workshop😝

3. Click here
     
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nadvolod/js-code/tree/master/web-testing-2022)

4. Once the Gitpod.io URL is loaded, you will need to sign in with the GitHub account you created earlier

### ✅ A new tab open with a simple ReactJS application should open

ℹ️ Keep the app running, we will need it to run some sanity tests

### Set your env variables

In a new terminal, run the following commands in that Terminal to set your `HAPPO_API_KEY`, `HAPPO_API_SECRET`:

[Happo api keys](https://docs.happo.io/docs/configuration#apikey-and-apisecret)

```bash
eval $(gp env -e HAPPO_API_KEY=<key>)
```
```bash
eval $(gp env -e HAPPO_API_SECRET=<secret>)
```

Once you have run those 3 commands, you can run the following commands to test your environment variables:

```bash
echo $HAPPO_API_KEY
echo $HAPPO_API_SECRET
```

### ✅ Your values should come back as expected

### Run tests

Run sanity tests

If your tests run in US Datacenter

```bash
npm run test:cy:sanity
```

### ✅👏Environment setup is complete if tests passed

---

## Local setup

### 1. Install Node LTS

1.  Use NVM for this installation by [following instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
    - It should be just a single command to run in our terminal
      - **!Don't forget to restart your terminal!**
    - After installation, confirm install with `nvm --version`
2.  Intall Node 16 with `nvm install --lts`

- Confirm node installation with `node --version` and seeing `v16.x` or similar
- Confirm NVM is set to 16 for default by running the following commands:

```bash
nvm list #will show all versions
nvm use 16 #to use 16
nvm alias default 16.14.x #to set it to the default
```

### 2.Clone and fork the repo

1. Sign up for a free [Github account](https://github.com/)
2. Fork this respository

- Make sure you are logged into Github
- click the Fork in the upper right of the Github.

3. Clone your fork of the repository to your machine. Must have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

```bash
git clone URL_OF_YOUR_FORK
```

#### ✅👏Congratulations, your local environment is ready!

## Prizes

Prizes will be given away for participation (tshirts, stickers...)

At the end, one lucky winner will get a backpack!
